# ShareAny

Share files and text anonymously. The web app collects nothing from you other
than text and files you shared, and all these will be permanently erased from
the server once you delete your shared space.

You can deploy it by yourself or access it at [shareany.net](https://www.shareany.net)

# Setup

Refer to the [readme](https://github.com/yang170/ShareAny/tree/master/conf) in
the conf folder for details on how to bulid docker images

# Other Variants

A distributed version of this web app can be found [here](https://github.com/yang170/ShareAnyDistributed-stable)
